The objective of this work is to develop a video recommendation system based on YouTube trend data. Since we do not have user data in the dataset, we can focus on content-based recommendation systems or general trends.

Popularity-based Recommendation: Identify and suggest videos with the greatest impact through metrics such as the number of views, likes, and comments, prioritizing those with a high level of interaction.

Content Similarity-based Recommendation: Analyze the topics and categories of the videos using video tags, employing text processing techniques to identify and recommend similar content.

Identify high-interaction videos and recommend related content.

Create an engagement score metric by combining likes, views, and comments to detect highly engaging videos and recommend similar content.

Recommendation based on similar channels: If a user has watched a video from a channel, we can recommend content from channels with a high engagement score or similar channels based on content similarity (e.g., tags).

Filter irrelevant videos*: Prioritize videos with high engagement and exclude those with low interaction or that are irrelevant. *This is more complex to do but we will see.

Make recommendations by country of origin: For instance, if a video has been published in Spain, recommend it to users in Spain or at least take it into account in the algorithm.

Process video descriptions and titles to find similarities and make recommendations.

Create a neural network to create a recommendation system

Use language sentiment processing to process tags
