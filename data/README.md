# YouTube Dataset: Explicit vs. Implicit Data

Explicit data refers to information that is directly provided by the user, platform, or content creators,
whereas implicit data refers to information that is generated based on user interaction, platform algorithms, or system tracking.
In our dataset, we have a combination of both types of data, separated as follows:

## Explicit Data

- **title**: The title of the video, explicitly set by the uploader.
- **channel_name**: The name of the YouTube channel that uploaded the video.
- **description**: The text description provided by the video uploader.
- **thumbnail_url**: The URL of the thumbnail, explicitly assigned or auto-generated by YouTube.
- **video_id**: A unique identifier for the video, assigned by YouTube.
- **channel_id**: A unique identifier for the channel, assigned by YouTube.
- **video_tags**: Tags provided by the content creator for categorization and search optimization.
- **kind**: Indicates the type of content (e.g., YouTube video).
- **publish_date**: The date when the video was published, explicitly recorded by YouTube.
- **language** (or "langauge" as it appears in your dataset): The language setting for the video, either set by the uploader or inferred by YouTube.

## Implicit Data

- **daily_rank**: The ranking of the video for a given day, derived from engagement metrics.
- **daily_movement**: The change in ranking from the previous day, inferred from user engagement trends.
- **weekly_movement**: The ranking shift over a week, based on aggregated engagement data.
- **snapshot_date**: The date when the data was collected, recorded by the system.
- **country**: The country where the video is trending or where the snapshot was taken, inferred from viewer location data.
- **view_count**: The number of views the video has received, recorded and updated by YouTube.
- **like_count**: The number of likes, tracked as users interact with the content.
- **comment_count**: The number of comments, generated from user interactions.
